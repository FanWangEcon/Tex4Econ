\singlespacing In this \href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3140132}{paper}, we look at how to reference sections and reference section page numbers. And we also include in the bibliography links to on which page the references were mentioned. Hyperref is used to show links in subsections in different ways, some clickable, some not.\end{abstract}

\paragraph{\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3140132}{Data}}

Village closure information is taken from a village head survey, which was collected in conjunction with household surveys. Village heads were asked if the village currently had a primary school, and asked about the year of school closure if the village school had been closed. Based on the village heads survey, there are four categories of closure status. The first category includes 193 villages that did not have village schools in 2011 and experienced school closure between 1999 and 2010. In the second category, which included 22 villages, a school closure year between 1999 and 2010 was reported, but village heads also reported that the village currently had a school in 2011. In this case, it is plausible that new schools were built in these 22 villages after school closure.\footnote{Generally students went to schools in township centers after village school closure, but in these 22 villages, it is possible that a new consolidated school was built inside these villages.}
