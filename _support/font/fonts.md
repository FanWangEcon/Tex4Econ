# Roman for Text and Palatino for Equations

**Issue**

Palatino equations seem significantly nicer looking, especially mathcal. But Palatino fonts too large. Including the two commands in preamble as below allows for roman font for text and palatino fonts for equations.

**Solution**

```{tex}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
% \usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{newtxtext}
```
