# Reveal.js Set Up

1. Go to the latest [reveal.js release](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases)
    - go to the end of the latest release's release info, look for zip file and download
    - just open the zipped folder, the index.html is already working.
2. To allow multiple files to share the same *css*, *js*, *lib*, and *plugin*, create a folder to put these folders from the zipped file.
    - in a *present* folder that is parallel to the *css*, *js*, and other folders, put in there testing and other html files.
    - replace links to css, js, lib and plugin in the testing files
