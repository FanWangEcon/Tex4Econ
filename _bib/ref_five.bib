 abstract = {Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs link public transfers to human capital investment in hopes of alleviating current poverty and reducing its intergenerational transmission. However, little is known about their longterm impacts. This paper evaluates longer-run impacts on schooling and work of the best-known CCT program, Mexico's PROGRESA/Oportunidades, using experimental and nonexperimental estimators based on groups with different program exposure. The results show positive impacts on schooling, reductions in work for younger youth (consistent with postponing labor force entry), increases in work for older girls, and shifts from agricultural to nonagricultural employment. The evidence suggests schooling effects are robust with time.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of school closure in the Chilean market-oriented educational system. Between 2000 and 2012 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1,651 schools closed -roughly one-sixth of the current stock- and 3,029 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which con- tains individual students' academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 46 and 62 percent (1.7 and 2.3 percentage points). Also, school exit implies a 78 percent increase in the probability of grade reten- tion in fifth grade. If we only consider those students that switch school at the end of the 4th grade we find an increase between 4.8 and 4.9 percentage points in grade retention.},

The extent of consolidation varies across states due to their considerable differences in history, geography, population density, and politics. Because economic crises often provoke calls for consolidation as a means of increasing government efficiency, the contemporary interest in consolidation is not surprising. However, the review of research evidence detailed in this brief suggests that a century of consolidation has already produced most of the efficiencies obtainable. Indeed, in the largest jurisdictions, efficiencies have likely been exceeded--that is, some consolidation has produced diseconomies of scale that reduce efficiency. In such cases, deconsolidation is more likely to yield benefits than consolidation. Moreover, contemporary research does not support claims about the},

	abstract = {The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities. The results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation. Bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a {pH} of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation. At {pH} values below about 6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt, and a low activity peak is seen around {pH} 5.5. This is the result of the binding of lipase to the "supersubstrate" and the activity of the catalytic site. In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the "supersubstrate" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished. Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship.},

paper studies the impact of the reduction in the number of primary schools on the migration
decision of rural residents. First, using China Health and Nutrition Survey that contains
information on community characteristics, we find that both the disappearance of village
primary school and the increased distance to nearby primary school increased the migration
probability of village residents. Second, using the 1\% population survey in 2005 and prefecture
level information, we find that the decline in the number of primary schools between 2000 and
2004 increased the migration probability of rural residents. Exploring the heterogeneous
effects, we find that the migration of individuals with primary-school-age children is more
sensitive to the relocation of primary schools, and that the effect is stronger for families with
boys than those with girls. These results suggest that human capital investment motive and
regional education policy play an important role in China's urbanization process.},

The policy put a high value on a centralized school layout with boarding schools, in sharp contrast with the policy in the 1980s, which focused on extending teaching to remote areas and running school in various forms. The differences between the two policies represent different values and development models, and reflect a trade-off between equity and efficiency. In an era after the "canceling teaching centers and merging schools" policy was revoked, rural education should absorb the essence of the  educational reform in the 1980s, reaffirm the principle of being practical and realistic, and lay stress on running schools in accordance with local conditions and in various forms.

	abstract = {In this study, the spatial structure of primary schools and alternative organizational frameworks are studied in a number of rural municipalities in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The aim of the study is to investigate how the spatial structure of schools has changed between the years 2008 and 2013 in these municipalities, what strategies the municipalities have developed to adapt their schools to changing conditions, and what constraints there are to apply the strategies at the local level. To answer these questions, semi-structured interviews with municipal representatives were conducted. Substantial changes to the spatial structure of school organizations through closures and mergers can be observed. The overall strategy for the future in all three national settings is a spatial structure with well equipped and well staffed schools in municipal centers and as few small village schools as possible, using information and communication technology ({ICT}) as a distance-bridging technology. The constraints to applying these strategies are on three different spatial levels. At the state level, the state places constraints regarding what municipalities and schools can and cannot do. At the municipal level, local politicians do not want to close schools for fear of losing the next election. At the community level, the constraints mainly lie in the resistance and strong social capital of the inhabitants who are focused on keeping their schools open irrespective of per capita costs.

	abstract = {Abstract
We estimate the impact of two early commitment of financial aid ({ECFA}) programs one at the start and one near the end of junior high school (seventh and ninth grades, respectively) on the outcomes of poor, rural junior high students in China. Our results demonstrate that neither of the {ECFA} programs has a substantive effect. We find that the ninth-grade program had at most only a small (and likely negligible) effect on matriculation to high school. The seventh-grade program had no effect on either dropout rates during junior high school or on educational performance as measured by a standardized math test. The seventh-grade program did increase the plans of students to attend high school by 15\%. In examining why {ECFA} was not able to motivate significant behavioral changes for ninth graders, we argue that the competitiveness of the education system successfully screened out poorer performing students and promoted better performing students. Thus by the ninth grade, the remaining students were already committed to going to high school regardless of {ECFA} support. In regards to the results of the seventh grade program, we show how seventh graders appear to be engaged in wishful thinking (they appear to change plans without reference to whether their plans are realistic).},

	abstract = {In the late 1990s and early 2000s, China's Ministry of Education embarked on an ambitious program of primary school mergers by shutting down small village schools and opening up larger centralized schools in towns and county seats. The goal of the program was to improve the teacher and building resources in an attempt to raise the human capital of students in poor rural areas, although it was recognized that students would lose the opportunity to learn in the settings of their own familiar villages. Because of the increased distances to the new centralized schools, the merger program also entailed building boarding facilities and encouraging or mandating that students live at school during the week away from their family. Given the magnitude of the program and the obvious mix of benefits and costs that such a program entails there has been surprisingly little effort to evaluate the impact of creating a new system that transfers students from school to school during their primary school period of education and, in some cases, making student live in boarding facilities at school. In this paper, our overall goal is to examine the impact of the Rural Primary School Merger Program on academic performance of students using a dataset from a survey that we designed to reflect transfer paths and boarding statuses of students. We use {OLS} and Propensity Score Matching approaches and demonstrate that there is a large ``resource effect'' (that is, an effect that appears to be associated with the better facilities and higher quality of teachers in the town and county schools) that appears to be associated with the transfers of students from less centralized schools (such as village schools) to more centralized schools. Boarding, however, is shown to have negative impacts on academic performance. However, students who transfer to county school benefit from the transfer no matter where they start and whether they board or not.},

However, for both of these arguments to be true, charter schools would have to replace low-performing public schools in currently disadvantaged, but revitalizing, neighborhoods. Using data from the Chicago Public Schools, the Common Core, and the Census, we examine the neighborhood and school-level factors that account for where elementary schools closed and opened in Chicago during the late 1990s and 2000s. We find that schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to close, but only because these were also underperforming and under-enrolled schools. After controlling for educational demand, new schools were more likely to open in neighborhoods that showed signs of socioeconomic revitalization and declining proportions of white residents.},

Most of the rise in the returns to education occurred after 1992 and reflected an increase in the wage premium for higher education. The rise is observed within groups defined by sex, work experience, region, and ownership, and is robust to the inclusion of different control variables. The timing and pattern of changing schooling returns suggest that they were influenced strongly by institutional reforms in the labor market that increased the demand for skilled labor.

Johannesburg - The Limpopo Education Department is to merge 301 schools and close down 176.

About 53 000 pupils and nearly 2 000 teachers - including principals - will be affected.

Education {MEC} Dikeledi Magadzi told the media on Wednesday that the decision was prompted by low enrolment at most of the affected schools.

She said the mergers were proposed by communities in some instances.


Kaalleegte Primary in Mokopane, in the Waterberg District, has five pupils and two teachers.

Two other nearby schools - Mokii Primary and Schaaphok Primary each have fewer than 20 pupils.

The schools have a total of five teachers.

The three schools will be merged with Sterkrivier Combined School, which has 79 pupils.

Last year, only three of the nine pupils passed matric at the combined school. This was an improvement from the zero pass rate in 2011, when nine pupils wrote matric.

Malimuwa Primary, which has eight pupils and one teacher, will merge with Soutpansberg Primary School in the Vhembe district.

Magadzi said some of the schools with low enrolment were separated only by a fence.

She cited the inadequate number of teachers, multi-grade teaching and many streams as major challenges that hampered the quality of teaching and learning.

Magadzi was confident the merger would reduce the workload on teachers and improve the quality of teaching.

She made a commitment that her department would provide transport for pupils forced to travel long distances as a result of the merger.

Magadzi said the {SA} Schools Act allowed affected parties to make presentations about the proposed mergers.

``The act provides an opportunity to the school governing bodies of the identified schools and any other interested persons, who must be given not less than 90 days, to make representations from the date of receipt of the notice,'' she said.

Department spokesman Phuti Seloba said none of the affected teachers would lose their jobs.

However, some of the principals would be stripped of their positions.

``That is why we are saying even those principals, definitely they will not lose their benefits, except the titles, which are insignificant,'' said Seloba.

It's not clear what will happen to the buildings at the schools to be closed.

Magadzi said Public Works was the custodian of government buildings.

Pat Kgomo, spokesman for the Public Works Department, said the decision on empty school buildings would be taken only after a full briefing from the Education Department.

Pupils were expected to vacate schools earmarked for closure in January.},

	abstract = {School consolidation may be an effective policy option in regions where demand for schooling is thin after taking into account its effects on the school commuting distance, the education quality and economies of scale. The effects of consolidation on the educational quality and the economies of scale have been well researched; but studies on the commuting distance are limited in scope because they usually rely on comparing distances pre- and post-consolidation which may exaggerate the consolidation's effect. In this study, optimization approaches are used to decompose school commuting distances at Yanqing, Beijing, based on survey data. The costs of long-distance school commuting as a result of consolidation are estimated after decomposing the effects of school districting, school location and financial stimulation. The findings indicate that these factors contribute significantly to pupils' long travel distance, and the negative effect of consolidation on school size standardization is exaggerated. These results imply that long-distance school commuting should not be the rationale for a suspension of the central government's consolidation policy.},

During Governor Quinn's tenure, he actively promoted consolidation as a solution for this funding crisis for the public schools of Illinois. This study analyzed this possible solution by exploring the impact of school consolidation on student achievement and the overall financial health of the districts involved. As local school leaders and stakeholders are forced to deal with the draconian challenge of the funding crisis in Illinois public schools, the results of this quantitative correlational ex post facto study provide information for these leaders to utilize when considering consolidation as a solution. When student achievement was examined, a statistically significant decrease occurred in five of the eight districts' average three-year percentage of students meeting or exceeding Illinois state standards on the {PSAE} reading test post-consolidation. When the financial health of the districts was examined, the results were inconclusive as it was a combination of districts improving or decreasing their average three-year revenues to expenditures ratios. The results of this study prompted the researcher to recommend Illinois lawmakers avoid any type of legislation that calls for forced or mandatory consolidation of school districts.},

	abstract = {Historically, the number of school districts in the United States has decreased despite the obvious increase in the number of students. One cause of the reduction in school districts is that small rural school districts merge or consolidate with each other, resulting in fewer school districts. When school districts consolidate, all aspects of the school districts' operations are impacted. Each year lawmakers and rural school district officials face dwindling finances, and each year these decision makers question whether or not to consolidate small rural school districts. Proponents tout the benefits of fiscal efficiency, a broadened curriculum and an increase in student achievement. Critics argue that the community suffers when schools close as the result of school district consolidation. This investigation had dual focus areas. One area of investigation focused on the fiscal efficiency of consolidated school districts by comparing per pupil expenditures. The other investigation focused on student achievement levels by comparing passing rate percentages on the state assessment tests. Expenditure and student achievement data were collected before and after consolidation. A paired samples t-test measured differences in efficiency, and the Lawshe-Baker Nomograph t-test measured differences in student achievement. The t-tests did reveal a statistical difference in expenditures and in student achievement. Per pupil expenditures increased while student achievement decreased for the absorbing district.},

Multiple regression analyses are employed to analyze the relationship between district size and per-pupil expenditures in the state of Michigan, focusing on the five most recent school years for which data are available. The study's results suggest that costs will continue to rise over time unless market incentives are introduced into the system. Arguably the study's most significant finding is that public school officials appear to maximize school operating spending regardless of the public demand for educational services. The introduction of market incentives could counteract this tendency by providing inducements for policymakers and school officials to reduce operating costs while maintaining or improving quality.

Research suggests that school closures are the outcome of racialized neoliberal policies and decades of disinvestment that have left many urban districts with fiscal deficits and declining student enrollments. However, some urban communities have successfully organized against school closures and reopened neighborhood schools. As such, this study examines how leaders in a community-university coalition in the Midwestern United States reopened a high school that was closed by its district. This case study draws on interviews and document data, and describes the forces that promoted school closure and its impacts on the community. Concepts from social capital and social network theories are used to guide the analysis. Findings indicate these leaders leveraged networks to negotiate a community-university social contract, took strategic and socially connected actions, and formed a community-driven education task force. This study offers implications for policy, future research, and communities in similar contexts.},

It is believed that school closure affects children's educational outcomes positively because children switch to better primary schools. At the same time, school closure creates a social disturbance such that educational outcomes may be affected negatively. There is no previous literature on the effect of this type of school closure on student performance. The empirical results indicate that student test scores are not affected by the school closure. Children are, however, tracked into higher secondary education levels after the school closure if they received more education years at the new primary school. This effect fades out and eventually becomes negative for children who received more than one education year at the new primary school. The results further suggest that there are no detrimental effects of a school closure in terms of educational performance. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {The subject of this analysis is the practice of school closures, since it constitutes a key response to demographic decline and is usually hotly disputed in regional discussions on demographic change. Our research is guided by two questions: How do political and administrative responses to demographic decline emerge? How is the practice of school closure publicly portrayed and discussed in the newspapers? We assume that in democratic welfare regimes, the spatial allocation of school infrastructures is mediated by the use of key administrative indicators allowing the calculation and public deliberation of questions related to education infrastructure policy. However, in transformation societies, a democratic political culture of ``governing by numbers'' only develops as a result of collective learning processes in which the participants acquire what we refer to as ``democratic numeracy''. In the stratified German school system, social prestige is conferred unequally among the different school types, with the grammar school (Gymnasium) being the most prestigious school type. It is therefore likely that the elements of the school system are not affected equally by policy responses to demographic decline and public attention, which results in spatial inequalities. Empirically, the article follows a mixed-methods approach, whilst emphasising a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of school closures in the regional press of Saxony-Anhalt from 1990 to 2014. The results show that, in the transformation process, the relevance of indicator-based governance of the school infrastructure increases both in practice and in discourse. However, as the participants gain in democratic numeracy, the use of numbers becomes politicised. With respect to the pattern of school closures, grammar schools receive a disproportionately large share of public attention. This has a positive effect on their survival chances and diminishes differences in spatial distances between grammar schools and integrated secondary schools. © 2017, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.

The results indicate that closing low-performing charter schools eventually yields achievement gains of around 0.2–0.3 standard deviations in reading and math for students attending these schools at the time they were identified for closure. The study also employs mandatory closure as an instrument for estimating the impact of exiting low-quality charter schools, thus providing plausible lower-bound estimates of charter school effectiveness. These results complement the more common lottery-based estimates of charter school effects, which likely serve as upper-bound estimates due to their focus on oversubscribed schools often located in cities with high-performing charter sectors.

The Hong Kong government overestimated post-1997-Handover mainland Chinese immigration and local births, creating excess capacity in many school districts. In 2003, with student enrollment falling to new lows (increasing cost per student), the government announced that it would close schools that were unable to recruit enough students. Since schools compete for students within their own district, the accidental excess capacity created closure threats that varied by district. Difference-in-differences analyses show that after initiation of this policy, student scores in heavily overbuilt districts were lower than scores in other districts and lowest in districts with the fewest students per class. Although closure threats were counterproductive for improving performance, the school closures eventually improved overall school quality, as typically, the lowest performing schools in each district closed. © 2016 by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Migration is often viewed as the best option for poor rural households to exit out of poverty, although the distributional effects of migrants' remittances tend to be ambiguous in the literature. Given that increasing income inequality is a major concern and policy issue, this paper examines the impacts of migration and migrants’ remittances on income inequality in China’s rural minority areas using recent proprietary household data. Treating migrants’ remittances as a potential substitute for income, the results reveal that migration significantly boosts income for all ethnic groups, although the returns to ethnic minority households tend to be less than for Han households. Decomposition analyses further reveal that migration increases inequality between ethnic groups despite reducing spatial inequality. These countervailing effects imply that the continual transfer of rural–urban migrants will likely lead to spatial convergence despite reinforcing ethnic inequalities in rural minority areas. Importantly, the percentage contribution of ethnic inequality to total inequality is larger than that of spatial inequality across sampled rural locations, thus highlighting the fact that the ethnic dimension is an important, yet often overlooked component of inequality in China.},

Using novel data from rural Pakistan on the caste composition of village hamlets and the location of primary schools, we investigate the impact of caste-based hierarchies on human capital accumulation, a key determinant of socio-economic mobility. We find that social stigma greatly discourages school enrollment among low-caste children, with low-caste girls, the most educationally disadvantaged group, being the worst affected. Our results imply that a policy of prioritizing school availability in settlements dominated by low-caste households would be a cost-effective way of increasing overall school enrollment.},
