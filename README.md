This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Tex4Econ/) of support files for writing various files with latex, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). The project includes sample file for papers, exams, homeworks, etc.

Materials gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which latex is used. The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find/re-use latex files produced for various projects.

This [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xjsqdwrkfrhq) is synced with this git repository. You can clone the project, pull project to overleaf, and compile in overleaf browser. Specifically: clone the repo; go to your overleaf account and create a project; click on menu under sync with git/github.

The writing/structure is to:
1. Store latex formatting file etc in separate files away from paper tex.
2. For papers, write in tex fragments stored in separate files. Main tex paper file mainly contains structure/outline.
3. Files synced through git/github, pull from github to edit/share with co-authors on [overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) or edit locally.

Please contact [FanWangEcon](https://fanwangecon.github.io/) for issues or problems.
