This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Tex4Econ/) of support files for writing various files with latex, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). The project includes sample file for papers, exams, homeworks, etc.

Materials gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which latex is used. The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find/re-use latex files produced for various projects.

Latex codes are tested to work with [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com). You can clone the project, pull project to overleaf, and compile in overleaf browser. Overleaf output pages with example PDF files are linked below.

The structure is to:
1. Store latex formatting file etc in separate files away from paper tex.
2. For papers, write in tex fragments stored in separate files. Main tex paper file mainly contains structure/outline.
3. Files synced through git/github, pull from github to edit/share on [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) or locally.

Please contact [FanWangEcon](https://fanwangecon.github.io/) for issues or problems.
